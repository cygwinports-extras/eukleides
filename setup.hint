ldesc: "Eukleides is a computer language devoted to elementary plane 
geometry. It aims to be a fairly comprehensive system to create 
geometric figures, either static or dynamic. Eukleides allows to handle 
basic types of data: numbers and strings, as well as geometric types of 
data: points, vectors, sets (of points), lines, circles and conics."
